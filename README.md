# saucenao-gelbooru-tagger

A Python tool to get Gelbooru tags from Saucenao results.

As far as I'm aware, Gelbooru unfortunately doesn't support this function in its API, so the tags are being extracted from the full page- not ideal, but it works.

To use with your own image - replace `'IMAGE URL HERE'` in main.py with a link to it.
